<p>Hi!</p> 
<p>Aren't giraffes a remarkable species?</p>
<p>There are so many interesting that excite me about giraffes.</p>
<p>Here are some mind blowing facts about giraffes that you might like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their "horns" are actually knobs covered with skin and hair above the eyes that protect the head from injury.</li>
<li>Giraffes have the longest stride of all land mammals and can run at 60 km/h (38 mph).</li>
<li>Males giraffes establish social hierarchies through "necking,” which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.</li>
<li>Their necks contain the same amount of vertebrae as we do (seven) except their bones are extremely elongated making their neck a long length of 2.4 meters.</li>
</ul>
